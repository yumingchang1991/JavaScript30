# YuMing's JavaScript30 Challenge
This is me following through the 30-day challenge designed by Wes Bos (visit [JavaScript30](https://JavaScript30.com) for details)

I create [this landing page](https://yumingchang1991.github.io/JavaScript30/) for better navigation.

All challenges are written from vanila JavaScript.
